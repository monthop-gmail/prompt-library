# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Purpose

This is a **Prompt Library** — a collection of AI prompts, guides, and references for development work. It contains no executable code; only documentation in Markdown format.

## Structure

```
prompt-library/
├── docs/                          # Main documentation
│   ├── doc-generator-prompts/     # Prompts for auto-generating project docs
│   ├── open-data-guides/          # Thai government Open Data guides
│   ├── project-plans/             # Project improvement plans & POCs
│   ├── rag-guides/                # RAG pipeline guides
│   └── workflow-guides/           # Git/AI workflow guides
├── references/                    # Chat logs from ChatGPT/DeepSeek
└── new/                           # Staging area for unsorted files
```

## Workflow

- The `new/` folder is a staging area for incoming files that need to be organized
- When organizing files from `new/`, analyze content and move to appropriate `docs/` subfolder
- Create new subfolders under existing categories when grouping related files

## Language

Most documentation is written in Thai. Respond in Thai when discussing content organization.
